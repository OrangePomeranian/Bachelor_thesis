The Pindel programme has been implemented in the C++ language. There is currently no parallelization implemented. The diagram below shows the process of preparing BAM files before they are passed through the Pindel programme. The analysis of NGS data to identify deletions and duplications using the Pindel algorithm consists of several steps and requires pre- and post-processing to exclude sequencing artefacts.
