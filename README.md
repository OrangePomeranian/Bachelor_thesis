# Comparison of CNVnator and Pindel tools basedon next generation sequencing data

The data used by the programs were obtained from 12 individuals of the Domestic Swine (Sus scrofa domestica) breed Wielka Bia≈Ça Polska. DNA was isolated from blood and sequenced using the Illumina platform. The main intention of the work is to compare algorithms for CNV detection such as Split-Read, Paired-End Mapping, Read-Depth, Assembly-Based or Combinatorial Approach, with particular emphasis on Split-Read and Read-Depth algorithms, which found their use in Pindel and CNVnator software.
